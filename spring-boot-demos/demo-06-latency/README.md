# Demo 06 — Low-Latency JVM: G1GC vs ZGC

**Spring Boot 4.0.5 / Java 21**

Two identical Spring Boot applications run simultaneously under identical GC
pressure. The only difference is the garbage collector. This demo shows
why that choice matters for p99 SLAs and HPA stability — and explains
the honest result when ZGC appears slower in a throughput test.

## Run the Demo

```bash
chmod +x demo.sh
./demo.sh
```

**Optional — for the `hey` load test (not included in the script by default):**
```bash
brew install hey       # macOS
# Linux: https://github.com/rakyll/hey/releases
```

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /info` | GC algorithm, heap usage, JVM version, container memory, collector names |
| `GET /pressure?mb=50&iterations=10` | Allocate N x MB, measure GC pause delta |
| `GET /gc-stats` | Cumulative GC collection count and total pause time |
| `GET /allocate?mb=100` | Simple allocation endpoint for load testing |
| `GET /actuator/health` | Liveness probe |
| `GET /actuator/prometheus` | Prometheus metrics |

## Why ZGC Appears Slower in Load Tests (and Why That's Fine)

You will likely see ZGC showing **lower throughput and higher average
latency** than G1GC in a load test. This is expected, honest, and worth
explaining to your audience.

### The load barrier cost

ZGC's concurrent design requires inserting a **load barrier** at every
point where application code reads an object reference from the heap.
When ZGC is relocating objects concurrently, the barrier checks whether
the reference is stale and transparently updates it. This overhead is
present on every object read, all the time — not just during GC.

G1GC has no equivalent constant overhead. It pays its cost differently:
by stopping all application threads for tens to hundreds of milliseconds
when a collection runs.

In a micro-benchmark like `/pressure` that allocates and reads many byte
arrays in a tight loop, you maximise the load barrier hit rate. ZGC pays
more per object access, which shows up as lower rps and higher average
latency.

### What actually matters for SLAs

The number that matters for SLAs is the **GC pause delta** — how much
cumulative time application threads were completely stopped, serving zero
requests. This is what Steps 4 and 5 of the demo measure:

| Metric | G1GC | ZGC |
|--------|------|-----|
| Throughput | Higher | Lower (load barrier cost) |
| Average latency | Lower | Higher (load barrier cost) |
| **GC pause delta** | **50-300ms per run** | **~0ms per run** |
| Application frozen for | Tens to hundreds of ms | Never |
| Will breach a 50ms p99 SLA? | **Yes, on every major GC** | No |

### The on-stage framing

> "ZGC is slower in total throughput here — that's the load barrier
> cost, and it's real. But G1GC froze the application for [N]ms during
> that test. ZGC froze it for less than 1ms. If you have a p99 SLA of
> 50ms, and G1GC pauses for 150ms every 30 seconds, you will breach it
> on schedule. ZGC won't. Choose based on your SLA, not this benchmark."

### When to choose each

| Workload | Choose |
|----------|--------|
| Batch processing, loose SLA, max throughput | G1GC |
| Latency-sensitive, p99 SLA < 50ms | ZGC |
| Very large heap (> 32GB) | ZGC (G1GC pauses scale with heap size) |
| CPU-constrained environment | G1GC (lower constant overhead) |
| HPA stability (avoid false scale-out from GC CPU spikes) | ZGC |

## Key Prometheus Queries

```promql
# GC pause P99 — compare G1GC vs ZGC side by side
histogram_quantile(0.99,
  rate(jvm_gc_pause_seconds_bucket[1m])
) * 1000

# Rate of GC pause time accumulation — shows G1GC spike pattern
rate(jvm_gc_pause_seconds_sum[1m]) * 1000

# Heap utilisation
jvm_memory_used_bytes{area="heap"} / jvm_memory_max_bytes{area="heap"}
```

---

## The HPA Connection

G1GC's stop-the-world pauses cause CPU spikes — all GC threads run flat
out for the pause duration, then drop back to zero. This looks exactly
like a traffic spike to CPU-based HPA. It scales out, the new pod runs
JIT warmup (more CPU), HPA scales back in. Continuous thrash.

ZGC's CPU profile is smooth. Load barriers add a small constant overhead
rather than periodic spikes. HPA has nothing to react to. The fix is
switching GC, not tuning `stabilizationWindowSeconds`.

## Production JVM Flags

```bash
# Minimum viable: switch GC (biggest impact, zero infrastructure change)
-XX:+UseZGC
-XX:+ZGenerational

# Add: match thread counts to your CPU request
-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=<N>
-XX:ParallelGCThreads=<N>
-XX:ConcGCThreads=<N/2>
-XX:CICompilerCount=2

# Add: pre-fault heap to eliminate page fault jitter at startup
-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch

# Add (with kernel + K8s config): huge pages
-XX:+UseLargePages

# Add (with Topology Manager single-numa-node): NUMA awareness
-XX:+UseNUMA
```
